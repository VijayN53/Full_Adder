Full Adder is a combinational logic circuit used to add three one-bit binary numbers, typically represented as A, B, and a carry-in (Cin).
It produces a two-bit output, a sum (S) and a carry-out (Cout).

The logic expression for the sum (S or Sum) is given by the XOR (exclusive OR) function of the inputs A, B, and Cin:

--> Sum=A^B^Cin

The carry-out (Cout or Carry) is generated by the OR function of two or more inputs among A, B, and Cin:

--> Carry=AB+BCin+ACin

Hence,RTL Schematic view, verilog HDL code, Test Bench WaveForm for Full Adder circuit is also attached.I have reduced the lines of code for the circuit by 
using a concatenation operator by concatenating both sum and carry for the respective binary inputs.
